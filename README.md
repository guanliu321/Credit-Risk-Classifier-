# Credit-Risk-Classifier-
C It is a Credit Risk assessment project performed on a dataset with more than 200,000 records,which helps the bank to evaluate if a loan applicant can be a defaulter at a later stage so that they can go ahead and grant the loan or not. Use pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplolib to perform exploratory data analysis, data visualization, find the missing value, and confirm important features. Perform data processing and feature engineering, compute missing value, eliminate noisy features and create new important features, in preparation for building models to evaluate customer loan eligibility. Use machine learning and statistical modeling algorithms to build multiple models to evaluate customer loan eligibility, such as Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Random forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neigbors. Choose Decision tree, Random forest from the five models with high evaluation accuracy, and use F1 score, Confusion Matrix, K-Fold cross-validation and Ensemble technique to select the best model Random forest. Utilized:Python,Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn,Matplolib,Exploratory Data Analysis,Machine Learning ,Statistical Modeling,Feature Engineering,KNN,Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest,Gaussian Naive Bayes,F1 score,Confusion Matrix,K-Fold Cross-Validation.
